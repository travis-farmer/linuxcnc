xset -dpms s off s noblank s 0 0 s noexpose

get a list of pins and parameters like this
8:25AM
in one terminal do
8:25AM
halrun
8:25AM
loadrt hostmot2
8:25AM
loadrt hm2_eth board_ip=10.10.10.10
8:26AM
in a second terminal do
8:26AM
halcmd show all hm2 > 7i80-pins.txt
look for something like encoder.N.counter-mode bit rw

 Open /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf for editing. Search for autologin-user=; uncomment line (remove #) and add username; also uncomment next line (autologin-user-timeout=0). Save file, close text editor, and reboot to test. As discussed below, it's not clear the second modification is needed, or even does anything, but it's the official Debian recommendation.

halcompile -i ./MacSafety.comp

watch iocontrol.0.emc-enable-in, hm2_7i80.0.7i70.0.1.input-15, MacSafety.0.EstopOut, with the MacSafety line enabled. make sure it performs correctly.
