 Open /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf for editing. Search for autologin-user=; uncomment line (remove #) and add username; also uncomment next line (autologin-user-timeout=0). Save file, close text editor, and reboot to test. As discussed below, it's not clear the second modification is needed, or even does anything, but it's the official Debian recommendation.
