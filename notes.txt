xset -dpms s off s noblank s 0 0 s noexpose

get a list of pins and parameters like this
in one terminal do
halrun
loadrt hostmot2
loadrt hm2_eth board_ip=10.10.10.10
in a second terminal do
halcmd show all hm2 > 7i80-pins.txt
look for something like encoder.N.counter-mode bit rw

 Open /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf for editing. Search for autologin-user=; uncomment line (remove #) and add username; also uncomment next line (autologin-user-timeout=0). Save file, close text editor, and reboot to test. As discussed below, it's not clear the second modification is needed, or even does anything, but it's the official Debian recommendation.

halcompile -i ./MacSafety.comp

watch iocontrol.0.emc-enable-in, hm2_7i80.0.7i70.0.1.input-15, MacSafety.0.EstopOut, with the MacSafety line enabled. make sure it performs correctly.
run the latency histogram for a while, and try changing the servo period to suit... see if any change.
